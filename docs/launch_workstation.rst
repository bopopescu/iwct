Launch workstation
******************


The IWCT workstation console allows you to start, stop, and connect to your workstations from any internet connected computer.

.. note::

    Make sure NX Client is installed on the computer you are using and that you can login to the `AWS Management Console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential>`_.  


To launch and connect to your workstation:

#. Go to the IWCT workstation console: http://iwct.dasgizmo.net
#. Click **login** and enter your username and password (or click **register** if you don't have an account).
#. Click the **connect** button next to a workstation workstation (or the **create new workstation"** button if no workstations are listed).

.. note::

    When you login for the first time, you'll be asked to provide your AWS Access Key.  You can copy the key from the `AWS console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential>`_ in the *Access Keys* section.  Your AWS Access Key will not be stored, but is used temporarily to create an IAM user and role as described in the `AWS identity best practices <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/IAMBestPractices.html>`_.
