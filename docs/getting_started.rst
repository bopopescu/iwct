Getting Started

The Image Webs Cloud Toolkit (IWCT for short) will create and manage a private
cluster computing environement just for you.  There are three elements.

:local desktop: The computer you are using now 
:iwct desktop: A persistent remote workstation setup for you in the AWS cloud.  The workstation can be shutdown when you don't use it and the content persists.  When you are done with a workstation, you can destroy it (and start from scratch with a new one if you like). 
:iwct cluster: A on-demand remote cluster setup for you in the AWS cloud.  You can start a private cluster in minutes when you need to compute, copy the output from the cluster FS back to your remote desktop, and destroy the cluster.

Prerequisites 
=============

To use IWCT you first need to create an AWS account and install NX client.   

Create an Amazon Web Services Account 
-------------------------------------

IWCT runs on the public Amazon Web Services cloud.  To use the cloud, you'll need an AWS account.

 - Go to http://aws.amazon.com, and then click Sign Up
 - Follow the on-screen instructions (it will ask for a credit card and a phone number)
 
 
Install NX Remote Desktop Client
--------------------------------

The NX client allows you to use a remote workstation in the cloud as if it were sitting right at your desk.   

 - Install the NX client for your OS (`Linux <http://www.nomachine.com/download-client-linux.php>`_, `Mac <http://www.nomachine.com/download-package.php?Prod_Id=3834>`_, `Win <http://www.nomachine.com/download-package.php?Prod_Id=3835>`_)
   

Launch and Connect to your IWCT Desktop
