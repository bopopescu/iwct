Setup

You will need to have the NX client installed on any computer from which you wish to work.  Also because IWCT launches computer resource on the public Amazon Web Services cloud, youâ€™ll need to create an AWS account. Follow the instructions below to get setup.

.. note::
   An Amazon Web Services account (for aws.amazon.com) is separate from any Amazon account you may already use for online shopping (for www.amazon.com).

Install NX Client
-----------------

*Time Required: 1 min*

The `NX client <http://www.nomachine.com>`_ allows you to use another computer remotely as if it were your local machine.   It is designed to give you virtually seamless full-screen graphical sessions even across poor connections like airplane WiFi or 3G mobile. Please install the free NX client for your OS:

 - `Linux <http://www.nomachine.com/download-client-linux.php>`_
 - `Mac OSX <http://www.nomachine.com/preview/download-package.php?Prod_Id=13>`_
 - `Windows <http://www.nomachine.com/download-package.php?Prod_Id=3835>`_


Create AWS Account
------------------

*Time Required: 5 min*

 #. Go to http://aws.amazon.com
 #. Click the **Sign Up** button
 #. Follow the on-screen instructions

.. note:: You'll need to provide a credit card and phone number to create an AWS account.

.. tip::   
   If you are a student or researcher, you can `request a grant <http://aws.amazon.com/grants/>`_ for free AWS credits.  When your grant credit is exhausted, your credit card will be charged once again.    
   
.. warning::
   When you complete a work session, always login to your `AWS management console <https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/>`_ and check that your workstation instances are stopped and your cluster instances terminated to avoid accidently wasting resources.
